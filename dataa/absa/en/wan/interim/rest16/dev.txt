We , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .####[([19], 'service general', 'NEG')]
They never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .####[([1], 'food quality', 'NEG'), ([12], 'food style_options', 'NEG')]
After all that , they complained to me about the small tip .####[([-1], 'service general', 'NEG')]
Avoid this place !####[([2], 'restaurant general', 'NEG')]

The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree .####[([8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], 'food quality', 'POS')]
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty ( could ' ve used a bit more salt ) .####[([4, 5], 'food quality', 'POS'), ([4, 5], 'food style_options', 'POS')]
The decor is night tho . . .but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling . . .its quite un - appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .####[([33], 'ambience general', 'NEG'), ([1], 'ambience general', 'POS'), ([14], 'ambience general', 'NEG')]
